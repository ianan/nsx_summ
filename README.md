# nsx_summ
Summary plots of NuSTAR solar obs with other X-ray data.

Some caveats:

* Lightcurve for whole field of view for NuSTAR over 2-10 keV
* Map for Nustar just FPMA, over whole pointing and 2-10 keV
* Source of features in NuSTAR might not be in the field of view, i.e ghost rays from elsewhere on the solar disk
* GOES flare list being used is from SSW latest events so some/many of the smaller events likely to be missing
* STIX lightcurve is quicklook only in 4-10 keV, so smaller features might actually be there (need to create own lightcurves from spectrogram/pixel data over narrower energy range)
